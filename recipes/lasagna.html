    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty,
      made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more
      traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my
      mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan.
      I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and
      crusty garlic bread.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).
      </li>
      <li>1 diced onion</li>
      <li>1 can of tomato sauce</li>
      <li>1 can of crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons of parsley</li>
      <li>1 crushed glove of garlic</li>
      <li>A dash of sugar</li>
      <li>Dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper</li>
      <li>Uncooked lasagna noodles</li>
      <li>Cottage cheese, parmesan, shredded mozzarella</li>
      <li>Eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook the meat: Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned and
        crumbly. Add the onion and continue cooking until it's translucent. Stir
        in the canned tomato products, half of the parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5
        teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Cook the noodles: Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water until
        they're al dente.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Make the cheese layer: Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, the
        remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Assemble the lasagna: Layer the ingredients according to the recipe
        (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until the lasagna is
        assembled.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Bake the lasagna: Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for
        about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is
        golden brown.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        In an oven preheated to 375 degrees F, this homemade lasagna should be
        perfectly baked in about 50 minutes (30-40 minutes covered, 5-10 minutes
        uncovered).
      </li>
    </ol>
